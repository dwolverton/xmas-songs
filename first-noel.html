    <div class="stanza">
        <p>The first Noel the angel did say,</p>
        <p>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;</p>
        <p>In fields where they lay keeping their sheep</p>
        <p>On a cold winters night that was so deep</p>

        <p>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel</p>

        <p>They looked up and saw a star, </p>
        <p>Shining in the East, beyond them far; </p>
        <p>And to the earth it gave good light; </p>
        <p>And so it continued both day and night. </p>

        <p>This star drew nigh to the North West, </p>
        <p>O'er Bethlehem it took its rest, </p>
        <p>And there it did stop and stay, </p>
        <p>Right over the place where Jesus lay. </p>

        <p>Then enter'd in there Wise Men three </p>
        <p>Full rev'rently on bended knee, </p>
        <p>And offered there in His presence </p>
        <p>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.</p>
