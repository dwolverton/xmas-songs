    <h1>O Holy Night</h1>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p>O holy night, the stars are brightly shining</p>
        <p>It is the night of our dear Savior's birth</p>
        <p>Long lay the world in sin and error pining</p>
        <p>Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth</p>
        <p>A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices</p>
        <p>For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn</p>
        <p>Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices</p>
        <p>O night divine - O night when Christ was born</p>
        <p>O night divine, O night, O night divine</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Truly He taught us to love one another</p>
        <p>His law is love, and His gospel is peace</p>
        <p>Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother</p>
        <p>And in His name all oppression shall cease</p>
        <p>Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we</p>
        <p>Let all within us praise His holy name</p>
        <p>Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever</p>
        <p>His power and glory - Ever-more proclaim</p>
        <p>His power and glory ever-more proclaim</p>
    </div>
